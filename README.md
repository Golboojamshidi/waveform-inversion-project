Kaggle competition project: Predicting subsurface velocity models from seismic waveform data using Python &amp; deep learning

# Waveform Inversion with Deep Learning  
📍 *A Kaggle Competition Portfolio Project by Golboo Jamshidi*  
🔗 [Kaggle Competition Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/waveform-inversion)

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is part of my transition into **data analytics** and was built as a submission to a Kaggle competition focused on seismic waveform inversion.

The goal is to use **deep learning** to predict 2D **subsurface velocity models** from simulated seismic waveform data—a challenging and exciting application of regression and signal analysis in geophysics.
